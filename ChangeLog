*metro-1.6.0 (22 Jan 2014)

  22 Jan 2014; Jonathan Vasquez <fearedbliss@funtoo.org>:
  New Features, Cleanups, and Bug Fixes

  * stage1 now exports 'xterm' as the ${TERM} in order to prevent the below error message:
    tput: No value for $TERM and no -T specified
  * devtmpfs is now being used for all stages to avoid the following message:
    openpty failed: 'out of pty devices'
  * util-linux is now installed in the stage1 so that we have the mount/umount commands in
    further stages.
  * Gradually cleaning up a lot of the code and syntax, including but not limited 
    to using [[ ]] instead of [ ], variables are now using brackets ${variable} 
    instead of $variable, and more.
  * Metro will now default to building stage4. A stage4 is what was previously a stage3.
    The stage3 will now be what it use to be in the old days where it only included @system
    and no extra packages. The stage4 will now include any further additions that Funtoo decides to add.
    Isolating the stage3 @system from the stage4 (Further packages) allows us to quickly rebuild a new stage4
    without having to recompile the @system set. This won't make much of a difference with the rolling release
    side of Funtoo since system packages are always being updated and need to be recompiled anyway, but it will
    make a huge difference for Funtoo semi-rolling/non-rolling builds since the @system set is Frozen.

    Note: A stage4 is now required for building new stages. During transition, just take a stage3 and rename it
    to stage4 and add a count number of 1 to the end:

    Example (Old): stage3-generic_64-funtoo-current-2014-01-01.tar.xz
    Example (New): stage4-generic_64-funtoo-current-2014-01-01-1.tar.xz
    
  * 'quick' multi-target has been removed (stage3-quick).
  * 'stage1', 'stage2', 'stage3', and 'stage4' multi-targets has been added.
  * Added support for frozen builds
  * Added stage4-freshen and updated stage3-freshen accordingly.
  * Creating the "targets/gentoo/source/seed/strategy/{local/remote}-{frozen/rolling}" files
  * Changed references to "New-style profile" to "Modern Profile"
  * Removed some debug code and cleaned up output messages
  * Added support for parallel xz and gz compression/decompression. 
    Also removed the 4 processor limit (-p4) on pbzip2 since pbzip2 by default uses the
    maximum amount of processors rather than a single core.
  * replaced 'die' functions with 'exit' from stage1 since that function cannot be found.
  * Removed stage1, stage2, and stage3 direct build support (via .control..), only stage4 will be directly built in
    a linear fashion.
  * Added 'rpackages' variable in the build.conf. This means 'rebuild-packages', basically what it does
    is that it ignores the --usepkg variable and always rebuilds this list of packages. Thus you can
    confidently place packages that need to compile against a kernel in this list so they can always be rebuilt.
  * All the stages now use the portage and python binary package if was previously compiled. 
  * Added build count support. All builds will default to a build number of 1 if not specified.
  * Added the following files for initial seed or other builds:
      .control/version/count
      .control/version/frozen
      .control/strategy/model
      
      For the count, you should put 1, for frozen if you are using it you put the date of the build you are using
      as a seed, and for strategy/model you put either 'frozen' or 'rolling'. If you use 'rolling' as the model,
      the application will not use the .control/version/frozen value but rather the .control/version/stage4 value
      which is updated every time you successfully build a stage4 (Same as has always been done).

  * A fifth parameter has been added to the metro program which is for the count. This parameter is optional and defaults to 1.
    Example: scripts/ezbuild.sh funtoo-current generic_64 full 14.1 1

    The above will build the '1' build of '14.1' for generic_64/funtoo-current. These are both strings so if you want you could
    easily say: scripts/ezbuild.sh funtoo-current generic_64 full tom jerry

    If no value is passed for the fifth parameter, you will get a "1" by default. So an example output stage4 file would be named:
    stage4-generic_64-funtoo-current-14.1-1.tar.xz

  * With the above frozen support, and the addition of the "count" parameter, means that we now have more flexibility and isolation
    with builds. We also have further reusability of the binary packages created during a build. In the above example, the
    "14.1" acts as the "common base" of all builds with that name, and the "1" acts as the build number to keep track of separate builds.
    For example, after you build 14.1 build 1, you can start a new build called 14.1 build 2 or build "tom" (or any other label since 
    it's just a string) and Metro will know that it should use the binary packages created from the last build of 14.1.

  * Updated Metro copyright years (2009 -> 2014)

*metro-1.3.0 (1 Apr 2009)

  1 Apr 2009; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@funtoo.org>: New feature enhancement
  release.

  NEW FEATURES:

  Multi-mode: Metro can now build multiple targets with a single command.
  This functionality is called "multi-mode" and the multi-mode settings
  are currently defined on a per-build basis, in /etc/metro/builds/.
  scripts/build.sh has been updated to take advantage of multi-mode.
  Multi-mode is used by passing "multi: yes" to Metro.

  Triggers: Triggers are arbitrary scripts that can be run when a build
  completes. In Metro 1.3.0, "success" triggers have been added to Metro.
  This allows digests to be generated, or critical files to be updated, when a
  build completes successfully. Metro currently uses triggers to update the
  "lastdate" and "subarch" control files. scripts/build.sh has been simplified
  as it no longer has to manually update the control files.

  Linux vserver target: Thanks to a contribution by Benedikt Bohm, 
  Metro can now build Linux vserver templates in addition to OpenVZ
  templates.

  New native32 and native64 subarches: have gcc optimize for your locally-detected
  CPU - contributed by Jeff Mitchell.

  New generic32 and generic64 subarches, which will use -mtune=generic and build
  a generic version optimized for modern CPUs. Be sure to use an x86 or
  amd64 seed stage for building your own generic32 and generic64 builds.

  New opteron and opteron-sse3 subarches. These are AMD-specific 64-bit
  builds.

  Phenom and i686 subarches have been improved.

  New, cleaner filesystem layout for the mirror directory -- yes, even more
  reorganization. Unstable funtoo builds are now in the "~funtoo" directory.
  Notice how the "~" is now associated with the build (there is a
  corresponding /etc/metro/builds/~funtoo.conf) rather than the subarch. If
  you want to build an unstable funtoo amd64 build, set metro/build: to
  ~funtoo and target/subarch: to amd64 (not ~amd64). This is a more logical
  and normalized path structure.
  
  scripts/build.sh has been updated so that it works the same way it always
  did -- "scripts/build.sh ~amd64 freshen" still does the same thing, for
  example, even though Metro no longer uses "~amd64" internally.

  SECURITY: 
  
  Local perms: Metro enforces stricter permissions on its work directories in
  order to prevent malicious injecting of files and/or binaries into builds.

  A security hole in baselayout-2.0.0 has been addressed by ensuring that
  /etc/shadow is readable and writeable only by the root user. An additional
  security baseline check has been added to all Gentoo targets which ensures
  that /etc/shadow and other critical files have proper permissions and
  ownership.
  
  PARSER:

  Parser now supports relative paths in collect annotations, such as
  "[collect ./stage/steps.spec]"

  Continued work on "new" parser, which Metro isn't using yet. Enhanced
  error reporting capabilities.

  BUILD IMPROVEMENTS:

  New chroot/test step which current performs a security baseline check for
  critical files to ensure that permissions and ownership are correct.

  gentoo/stage3-freshen target now uses --deep and --newuse. gentoo/stage3
  now runs eselect vi to enable busybox vi on the default stage3 build.

  gentoo/stage3-freshen target now emerges @preserved-rebuild set if it
  exists to ensure things are properly rebuilt.

  chroot-based targets now run steps/chroot/{pre,post}run, just like the
  stage targets. (Contributor: Benedikt Bohm)

  New portage/devices target to specify the device node sets to create
  using MAKEDEV (Contributor: Benedikt Bohm). Specifying device node sets
  will cause Metro to not bind-mount /dev and /dev/pts inside the build
  chroot.

  GENERAL BUG FIXES:

  Bind mounts will work properly even if /var/tmp/metro contains a symlink
  somewhere in the path (ie. /var/tmp is a symlink.) (Credit for bug report:
  Tim Dysinger)

  Even more bind-mount robustness fixes, which don't fix a particular bug
  but should handle unusual problems even more carefully.

*metro-1.2.3 (02 Feb 2009)

  02 Feb 2009; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@funtoo.org>: New feature enhancement
  release: "package cache" support for stage1/stage2/stage3/stage3-quick,
  every build has its own private compiler cache directory, reworking of
  directory structure for caches in /var/tmp/metro, stage3-quick build fix,
  tar command-line rsync snapshot fix from Yannick Chabanois
  (yannickchabanois@zugaina.org), probe enhancements and normalization,
  Phenom support from VÃ­ctor RomÃ¡n Archidona <daijo@daijo.o>, world file
  fix.

*metro-1.2.2 (19 Dec 2008)

  19 Dec 2008; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@funtoo.org>: Parser bug fix
*metro-1.2.1 (17 Dec 2008)

  17 Dec 2008; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@funtoo.org>: New release: fix a
  couple of silly bugs.

*metro-1.2 (15 Dec 2008)

  15 Dec 2008; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@funtoo.org>: New release:
  The 1.2 release contains quite a few 
  * NEW target: "stage3-freshen" uses emerge -up world to update stage
  * NEW target: "stage3-quick" builds stage3->stage3, skipping stage1 and 2.
  * NEW target: "git-snapshot" creates a full .tar.bz2 snapshot of git repo
    with the .git directory intact, so it is a full working git repo when
    unpacked.
  * NEW target: "emerge" for adding packages to an existing stage3
  * NEW subarch: ~core2 for Intel Core 2 series processors. Supported with
    gcc 4.3.2 which is in the funtoo build.
  * Updated targets: "openvz" updated to support OpenRC 0.4.0.
  * stage3-freshen supports emerge/packages/force target, which is a list
    of packages to rebuild using "emerge <packages>". This is a great way
    to force a rebuild of packages that may need to be rebuilt but did not
    get a rev-bump (ie. openrc.:)
  * Metro now properly cleans /var/tmp/metro after it is done, unless the
    build aborted due to an error.
  * scripts/build.sh: now supports stage3-freshen and stage3-quick by
    allowing an extra "quick" or "freshen" option as the last argument.
  * scripts/build.sh: now creates a "current" symlink pointing to the most
    recent stage3 built. This "current" symlink exists in the subarch
    directory and the filename is "stage3-subarch-current.tar.bz2."
  * scripts/build.sh: now uses "git-snapshot" for funtoo builds, so funtoo
    snapshots are now double the size but are a full working and "git pull"-
    able git repo, simplifying funtoo install process.
  * stage3 targets: try to ensure that /etc/make.conf.example exists.
    Create a symlink from /etc/make.conf.example to
    /usr/share/portage/config/make.conf.example.
  * metro core: robust mount point detection using /proc/mounts instead of
    output from the mount command, which can be unreliable.
  * metro core: more robust umount algorithm.
  * metro core: local name support, so your custom stages don't need to be
    called "funtoo" anymore. Also quite useful with the "emerge" target for
    creating custom stage3's with different names.
  * metro core: ccache works correctly, but has been disabled by default as
    it may cause build failures when used with Portage parallel merges
    (--jobs) and we now have "stage3-freshen" and "stage3-quick" when we need
    a stage3 built quickly.
  * parser syntax: For conditionals, the "in" keyword is now supported as
    an equivalent for "is".
  * parser syntax: New "lax" expansion method, ie: $[foo:lax] will expand
    to foo if it is defined, otherwise it will not throw a parser error
    (as it normally would) and instead expand to a dummy value which may
    contain spaces.
  * Documentation: github wiki documentation updated to reflect new features
    and QuickStart Guide refined to be easier to understand.
  * Projects: new projects/ directory contains source code for funtoo.org
    Web site. Funtoo.org Web site redesigned to be more of a portal for new
    Funtoo builds. The funtoo Web site can be generated by running
    "pytext index.html" (sent to stdout.) Embedded python code automatically
    updates Web site symlinks to point to most recent versions of builds
    and list relevant build-related information. Support for displaying
    build dates in human-parseable form (ie. "Yesterday" or "2 Days Ago".)

*metro-1.1 (04 Nov 2008)

  04 Nov 2008; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@funtoo.org>: New release:
  * Reorganized /etc/metro directory
  * NEW: "Builds" defined in /etc/metro/builds/ - all key build information
    now in a single file for convenience.
  * NEW: "FSLayouts" defined in /etc/metro/fslayouts/ - all mirror-related
    file names and path structures now in a single file.
  * NEW: OpenVZ template support for Funtoo stages, enabled in 
    scripts/build.sh
  * NEW: Reorganized file paths inside /usr/lib/metro.
  * NEW: Working gentoo/emerge target, when you just want to take a stage3
    and create something new by emerging stuff in it.
  * NEW: Targets now have an OS prefix. What was target: snapshot is now
    target: gentoo/snapshot, etc. The path structure in /usr/lib/metro has
    also been improved so that people can easily create a
    /usr/lib/metro/targets/myos/ directory and start hacking.
  * NEW: Several parser bug fixes
  * FIX: Improvements to metro have allowed scripts/build.sh to be simplified.
  * NEW: Improved error and exception handling
  * NEW: Enhanced Portage git snapshot support - Metro will now keep a
    local cache of a git repository so it doesn't need to re-clone it
    every time, saving bandwidth. This cache location is defined in the
    path/cache/git variable in /etc/metro/metro.conf.
  * Embedded Python interpreter can no longer reference Metro metadata
    directly. This prevents weird side-effects from occurring.
  * NEW: Conditional expansion - a variable such as $[foo?] will get
    expanded to "yes" if defined and "no" if not defined, providing
    easy integration with scripts so you don't throw a parser exception
    by referencing an undefined variable.
  * NEW: "zap" expansion - in a multi-line element, a variable such 
    as $[foo:zap] will get expanded to the name of the variable if it is
    defined. If it is not defined, however, then the entire line will
    be deleted from the output. This allows very compact conditional
    lines in templates like this:
    CFLAGS=$[portage/CFLAGS:zap]
  * FIX: MAKEOPTS now properly applied to Gentoo builds, speeding up
    builds on multi-core systems significantly.
  * NEW: [options parse/lax] and [options parse/strict] to disable and
    enable strict parsing, respectively. When lax parsing is enabled,
    any referenced undefined variables in multi-line elements will get
    dummy values, but an exception will not be thrown.
  * NEW: conditonal sections - it's now possible to write:
    [section foo when bar]
    This is equivalent to the old:
    [section foo]
    [when bar]
  * NEW: conditional equality - it's now possible for all conditionals
    to test for equality, such as:
    [section foo when bar is oni]
    or
    [when bar is oni]
  * NEW: conditional list-match - it's now possible to see if an element
    matches a list of values, such as:
    [section foo when target/subarch is x86 amd64 pentium4]
    This section will be active if target/subarch has a value that matches
    one of the specified values.
  * CHANGE: multi-line elements that are referenced inside other multi-line
    elements, using the syntax $[[foo]], will only get expanded if they
    appear at the beginning of the line. This allows them to easily be
    commented out by prefixing them by a "#" or any other character. In this
    case, the $[[foo]] will not be expanded and will be passed to the output
    as-is.
  * CHANGE: path/mirror/srcstage and path/mirror/deststage have been
    renamed to /path/mirror/source and path/mirror/target respectively.
